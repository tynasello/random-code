A React.js TypeScript blog application where users can view and interact with posts. Frontend makes use of custom blog API.

To be the admin of this blog, login with username: "admin" and password: "adminpass". This will allow you the ability to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as delete post comments.

Inspiration for this project was found while following the tutorials on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), and advancing to the blog-api section.
