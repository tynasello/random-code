My Recreation of the popular game Flappy Bird.

The code for this project was written in Python leveraging the Pygame library.

The program's game loop is responsible for processing user input and updating object states and game display. I created custom game events and entity classes using inherited properties and methods from PyGame's Sprite class.

The tutorials on [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/), and [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-start-menu-tutorial/) assisted me in using PyGame effectively.
